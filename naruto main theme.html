<body><h1>Naruto</h1><p>Toshio Masuda (増田 俊郎, Masuda Toshio, born October 28, 1959) is a Japanese composer. He has composed and synthesized scores for several Japanese television shows and animated series. Masuda is perhaps best known as the composer of the 2002 hit anime series Naruto where he combined traditional instruments like the shamisen and shakuhachi together with guitar, drums, bass, piano and other keyboard instruments along with chantingFriendship, Hope, and Sacrifice. Naruto (the show) establishes these three as the absolute crux of humanity. Naruto's (the character's) main focus is his friends whom he never loses hope in and would sacrifice everything for, to the point of giving himself a heart attack at the thought of losing his closest friend.
